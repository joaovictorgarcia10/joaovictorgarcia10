Hi, Iâ€™m JoÃ£o Victor Garcia! I hope that all you are well ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm a software developer and technology enthusiast because of its power to transform ideas into reality, dynamize the static and democratize the restricted. I have been acting as a Flutter developer in projects of several segments such as: Warehouse Management, Digital Bank and Education Platform. I am also experienced as a Flutter Instructor.

I'm enthusiast of software architecture and good practices like TDD, DDD and Clean Architecture.

Currently, I'm learning Swift.
